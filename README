SPRINTER CELL
=============

Stealth game


SPRINTER CELL is a game where the player has to hide from the enemies,
represented by the red dots.
The enemies must not detect the player while he tries to collect as many
bonuses as possible. If the player gets caught, the game ends and displays
the player's best score.
As the rooms are entirely randomly generated, the player may go from room to
room until he gets caught.
The enemies' field of vision is mostly based on our sound engine: when the
player moves, sound waves come out of it. If these waves hit an enemy, he then
hears you and catch you.
Be careful though! Even the walls are covered with high sensitive captors. If
you even try to touch a wall, you'll also be detected.. You won't have many
friends in there!

The whole game design is based on flat design, with a Mirror Edge type style:
very flat and simple, but yet great to look at, with powerful colors.
